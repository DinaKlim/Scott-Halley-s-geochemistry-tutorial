[The notebook](https://github.com/DinaKlim/Scott-Halley-s-geochemistry-tutorial/blob/main/SHG_Tutorial1.ipynb)

Exploring relationships between Sc and Th, Ti, V, P, Nb, Cr with pair plots (functions from Morgan William's Pyrolite library)

An attempt to perform clustering in Th/U space to see if the clustering-based lithology classification corresponds to the approach of defining lithology classes based on density contours in iogas
